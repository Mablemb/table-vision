# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-08-07

### üêõ Fixed
- **Table Deletion Bug**: Fixed issue where detected tables displayed in the right panel couldn't be deleted
- **Coordinate Persistence**: Deleted coordinates no longer reappear after deletion due to coordinate list merging issue
- **Batch Extraction Inconsistency**: Fixed coordinates from batch extraction not being added to coordinate manager
- **Duplicate Coordinate Storage**: Fixed coordinates being stored twice in coordinate manager during regular extraction
- **Batch Accumulation Issue**: Fixed batch extraction refreshing coordinates instead of properly accumulating them
- **Real-time Deletion**: Deletion now works throughout batch extraction process, not just at the end
- **UI Responsiveness**: Delete operations now properly update both viewer and editor displays

### üîß Technical
- Modified `delete_coordinate()` method to remove coordinates from both `coordinates_manager` and `all_extracted_coordinates`
- Enhanced `on_page_extraction_completed()` to maintain both data structures incrementally during batch processing
- Simplified `on_batch_extraction_completed()` to focus on UI cleanup since coordinates are now maintained incrementally
- Fixed `on_extraction_finished()` to prevent duplicate coordinate storage
- Added comprehensive debug logging for coordinate management operations
- Streamlined coordinate management for consistency between extraction methods
- Added comprehensive debug logging for coordinate deletion tracking
- Enhanced coordinate synchronization between different data sources

## [2.3.0] - 2025-08-07

### üéØ Fixed
- **Critical Export Bug**: Fixed coordinate system mismatch between visualization and image export
- **Aspect Ratio Issues**: Resolved landscape tables exporting as portrait images  
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Export now uses same Y-axis flipping as visualization for perfect alignment
- **PyMuPDF Clipping**: Fixed high-DPI clipping issues causing dimension swapping
- **Image Cropping**: Export images now precisely match red rectangle positions

### ‚ú® Added
- **Full-page Render Approach**: New rendering method using full-page + PIL crop for better reliability
- **Enhanced Debug Output**: Comprehensive coordinate transformation logging for troubleshooting
- **Coordinate Validation**: Better bounds checking and error handling for invalid coordinates
- **Aspect Ratio Detection**: Debug output now shows expected vs actual aspect ratios

### üîß Technical
- Replaced PyMuPDF clipping with full-page render + PIL crop to avoid dimension issues
- Synchronized coordinate transformation between `viewer.py` and `renderer.py`
- Added Y-axis flipping in renderer to match visualization coordinate system
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases in coordinate transformation

### üìä Results
- **Before**: Expected 1812√ó1743 landscape ‚Üí Got 1871√ó2480 portrait (wrong orientation)
- **After**: Expected 1812√ó1743 landscape ‚Üí Got 1812√ó1743 landscape ‚úÖ (perfect match)

## [2.2.0] - 2025-08-06

### ‚ú® Added
- **Page Range Selection**: Extract tables from specific page ranges (start and end pages)
- **Efficient Processing**: Process only selected pages instead of entire documents
- **UI Controls**: Intuitive page range controls in toolbar with validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Progress indicators show current page within selected range
- **Better Testing**: Easy system testing with selective page processing

### üîß Technical
- `BatchExtractionWorkerCustom` class for page range processing
- Page range validation and error handling
- Enhanced progress reporting for selected ranges
- Improved batch processing efficiency

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-06

### üêõ Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed Camelot-detected tables not displaying visually on screen
- **Coordinate System**: Completely rewritten coordinate transformation logic in `viewer.py`
- **Double Scaling**: Resolved issue where scale factors were applied twice, causing rectangles to appear off-screen
- **Y-axis Flipping**: Corrected transformation between PDF bottom-left origin and screen top-left origin coordinate systems
- **Rectangle Positioning**: Fixed calculation of screen coordinates for proper visual overlay of table boundaries

### ‚ö° Improved
- **Performance**: Optimized coordinate transformation calculations for faster rendering
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug output for coordinate conversion troubleshooting
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in coordinate transformation methods
- **Code Quality**: Improved code documentation and inline comments

### üîß Technical Details
- Simplified coordinate transformation from complex double-scaling to clear two-step process
- Fixed `_coord_to_screen_rect()` method to properly handle PDF page dimensions
- Corrected `_screen_to_coord_rect()` method for accurate reverse transformations
- Updated coordinate calculation to account for 2x rendering scale and viewer zoom separately

### üìä Before/After
- **Before**: `QRect(532, 1553, 49, 110)` - Y coordinate 1553 was off-screen (pixmap height: 1682)
- **After**: `QRect(544, 507, 54, 122)` - Properly positioned within visible screen bounds

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-15

### ‚ú® Added
- Interactive PDF viewer with table overlay system
- Real-time table boundary editing with mouse interactions
- Batch table extraction with progress tracking
- Session management for saving/loading extraction results
- High-quality image export functionality
- Comprehensive settings panel for customization

### üîß Technical
- PyQt5-based GUI framework implementation
- Camelot integration for automatic table detection
- PyMuPDF for PDF rendering and processing
- Coordinate management system for table boundaries

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-01

### ‚ú® Initial Release

- Command-line interface for PDF processing
- Simple coordinate extraction and storage
- Ghostscript integration for PDF processing
